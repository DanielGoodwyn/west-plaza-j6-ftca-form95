[ðŸ”²] User Login and Editing After Signature
[ðŸ”²] User account flow: users submit with email (no login required); email becomes username; only one submission per email (new replaces old); after submission, prompt to create password (optional); if skipped, store temp password in DB (user does not know it; admin can provide); users can set/reset password later via link
[ðŸ”²] Authentication & roles: login page for users, admins, superadmin; only admins/superadmin see admin dashboard; users can edit/download own submission/PDF; admins can manage all; superadmin can manage users/admins (add/remove/edit/promote/demote); only one superadmin
[ðŸ”²] Password management: passwords hashed in DB; users/admins can reset via email link
[ðŸ”²] Access control & security: all sensitive actions require authentication; no user can access another's PDF unless admin/superadmin
[ðŸ”²] Email verification (last phase): require before login/editing; prevents someone else using their email
[ðŸ”²] Admin impersonation (optional, low priority): admins may impersonate users for support
[ðŸ”²] Basic Notification
[âœ…] Objective: Send a simple notification upon successful PDF generation. (Logging done, not email)
[ðŸ”²] Task: Create utils/notifier.py. Write a function to send an email using smtplib.
[ðŸ”²] Configuration: Allow setting SMTP server, sender/recipient emails (via env or config file, keep sensitive info out of Git)
[ðŸ”²] Integrate into /submit route. (Logging is integrated)
[ðŸ”²] For MVP, just log to console: "Notification: PDF generated for [Claimant Name]".
[ðŸ”²] Add/Edit button on review page to allow user to edit submission before signing
[ðŸ”²] Client-side JavaScript validation for better UX (required fields, data types, char limits)
[ðŸ”²] Server-side validation enhancement: more comprehensive checks
[ðŸ”²] Calculation for Field 12d (Total) on frontend and backend
[ðŸ”²] Improve handling of checkbox for Field 3
[ðŸ”²] Interactive PDF review & signing workflow (review, sign, download signed PDF)
[ðŸ”²] Improved styling & responsiveness (static/css/style.css)
[ðŸ”²] Robust error handling & logging (comprehensive backend errors, user-friendly frontend messages, structured logging)
[ðŸ”²] Security hardening (CSRF protection, input sanitization, file permissions, rate limiting)
[ðŸ”²] Configuration management (move config to env/config file)
[ðŸ”²] Admin portal features (dashboard, data grid, CSV download, PDF management, consolidated PDF download)
[ðŸ”²] Dockerization (Dockerfile, dependencies, test Docker run)
[ðŸ”²] Unit & integration testing
[ðŸ”²] Documentation review & update (README.md, operational procedures)
[ðŸ”²] Ongoing monitoring & maintenance (logs, backups, dependency updates)
[ðŸ”²] User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
[ðŸ”²] Documentation Review & Update
[ðŸ”²] Ongoing Monitoring & Maintenance
[ðŸ”²] Only admins and superadmin see the admin dashboard.
[ðŸ”²] Users can log in to edit their own submission and download their own PDF, but cannot access or download others' PDFs.
[ðŸ”²] Admins can view/edit/download all submissions and PDFs.
[ðŸ”²] Superadmin can manage (add/remove/edit/promote/demote) users and admins, and has all admin powers.
[ðŸ”²] Only one superadmin account exists.
[ðŸ”²] Passwords are securely hashed in the database.
[ðŸ”²] Users and admins can reset their password via a "forgot password" flow (email-based link).
[ðŸ”²] All sensitive actions require authentication.
[ðŸ”²] No user can access or download another user's PDF unless they are admin or superadmin.
[ðŸ”²] Email verification will be required before allowing login/editing (to prevent someone else from using their email). Implement this as the final step after all other features are complete.
